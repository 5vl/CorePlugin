I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PLUGINS LIKE THIS - THIS IS JUST A FUN PROJECT THAT I'M WORKING ON. PLEASE DO NOT SEND HATE FOR THIS REASON.

This is a core plugin by 5vl. I just started coding plugins, and I'm still woking on updating the code. The current features are:
- Shortened versions of gamemode commands (/gmc, /gms, /gma, /gmsp)
- Fly command
- Heal command
- Ban, kick and unban commands
- Almost fully customizable via the config file

Permissions: 
- /gmc - core.gmc
- /gms - core.gms
- /gmsp - core.gmsp
- /gma - core.gma
- /heal - core.heal
- /fly - core.fly
- /ban - core.ban
- /unban - core.unban
- /kick - core.kick
- /discord - none
